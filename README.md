# Chronic-Kidney-disease-prediction
The project contains 6 classifier algorithms for Chronic-Kidney-disease(CKD) prediction along with the Pre-Processing of Dataset.
Each algorithm returns the accuracy scores obtained
# Dataset
The dataset is from UCI machine learning repository. Containing 24 attributes, 1 class label column and a total of 400 instances.
# Guide
The raw data file is directly from the website without preprocessing.

Use the CKD_dataset_preprocessed_Catboost file for catboost classifier and CKD_dataset_preprocessed for other classifiers. These two files are completely preprocessed.
